Computational results of PLUTo `ami-phylo` analysis of phylogenetic trees from _Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol._

This is designed to be an Open Notebook Science project where all parts of the research are visible to everyone in the world. The data is committed immediately it is extracted, other than the unavoidable delay of manually committing to Github (we may look into automation later). Anyone is welcome to get involved, and in principle become committers.

This repo holds the total process of extracting NEXML trees from JISEM diagrams and converting them into Newick and building a supertree. As this is the first such exercise we necessarily encounter computational problems, so the processes may be re-run several times, and often on sub-samples.

First supertree from a 24hr analysis of the MRP matrix of 2269 taxa:
